An Arduino controlling LED grow lights.

Here is a link to a build page for my grow-light system: [Growing Lithops from Seed - Josh Does a Thing](https://www.joshdoesathing.com/growing-lithops-from-seed "Growing Lithops from Seed - Josh Does a Thing")

The main code file is [plant\_led\_lights.ino](plant_led_lights.ino) and [plant\_led\_lights\_EXPLANATION.md](plant_led_lights_EXPLANATION.md) contains a through walk-through of the file.

I use my own class, `GrowLight`, defined in [GrowLight.h](GrowLight.h) and [GrowLight.cpp](GrowLight.cpp) and explained in [growlight\_class\_walkthrough.md](growlight_class_walkthrough.md).
